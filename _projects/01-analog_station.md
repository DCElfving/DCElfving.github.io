## Overview
A hands-on workshop in a kit, <em>The Analog Station</em> merges the tactile vibe of analog meters with modern sensor technologies and creative code. All with a warm analog glow!

Participants work with their instructor and each other to assemble and program their own devices. All materials, tools and support are provided. Upon completion, students will have a working knowledge of techniques for creative coding, and a fun device <em>they built themselves</em> to take home.

## What does it do? Two things!
**Audio Mode**: Bass, mids, and treble each get their own meter. Bring an analog visualizer to your desk or sound system. It responds to music, ambient noise, or voice.

**Climate Mode**: With the flick of a switch, <em>The Analog Station</em> displays temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.
