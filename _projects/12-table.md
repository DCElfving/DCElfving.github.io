I'd been tinkering with woodworking for a few years, but never quite mustered the courage to design a piece of furniture. That all changed under the tutelage of <a href="https://www.adriensegal.com">Adrien Segal</a> and the <a href="https://www.cca.edu/design/furniture/">CCA Furniture Design</a> team. 

The images below document the entire process. Designing with wood is humbling â€“ gotta respect the tree!
