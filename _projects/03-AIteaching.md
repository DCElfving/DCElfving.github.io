ChatGPT launched during the Ides of March, 2023. Right in the middle of my Spring semester at the California College of the Arts. I was eager to share it with my class â€“ could I help Interaction Design students realize a gesture based interface?

I was honored to sum up the whole experience in 5 minutes at the Long Now Ignite talks:

The answer, of course, was a resounding "yes". But I hasten to add that teaching with AI is not easier. Precisely because it's so capable, AI requires *more* of teachers and students.
