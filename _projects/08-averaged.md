Usually the purview of astronomers, these images were created by "stacking" a number of photos. An application designed to stitch landscapes into a panorama was tricked into to layering multiple images of the same subject.

Mostly as a learning experience, I made several of these available as inexpensive NFT works on the short lived Hic et Nunc platform.
