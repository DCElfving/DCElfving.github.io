This is ongoing project exploring the relationship between generative art and photography. These images were generated with image and face data, and made tangible with silver gelatin prints and a pen plotter.

There's something deeply satisfying about watching the pen plotter work for hours with absolute precision. It makes me feel productive while doing absolutely nothing.

The patterns are created with <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>, an open source software environment for creating with code. As computers work way faster than plotters, thirty patterns are created each second.
