In my Fundamentals of Interaction Design class at <a href="https://www.cca.edu/design/ixd/">CCA</a>, I guide students through a project using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">design thinking</a> process. It's easy to illustrate and grasp, but students quickly learn the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-design-thinking-is-hurting-user-centered-design-d40cad6da5ee">depth of work</a> required for thoughtful design.<sup>1</sup>

For the Fall 2024 semester, we enthusiastically set out to redesign the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/time-park-know-your-meter">SFMTA parking meters</a> we noticed people struggling with around campus. 

But this is not a story about parking meters...

Before the semester began, I was *certain* students would use AI to create wireframes and prototypes. I envisioned them describing parking meter functionality with sketches and text, then modifying AI generated output. I even <a href="https://youtu.be/fnWSxrYXOro?si=GgWZZvZuL1HtrTqr">gave a presentation</a> on how I was preparing to teach with it.  

Only it didn't happen. My students created their demos the old fashioned way, by dragging rectangles and searching for ready-made templates. Instead, AI empowered them to *test* their solutions in ways I didn't anticipate.

In October of 2024, I encountered <a href="https://listenlabs.ai">listenlabs.ai</a> <sup>2</sup> at an <a href="https://sf.aitinkerers.org">AI Tinkerers</a> meet-up here in San Francisco. In a Lower Haight basement crowded with folding chairs and flanked by gaping pizza boxes, their demo was astonishing. Qualitative research that used to require days of observation, transcription and synthesis could be produced overnight.

Listenalabs uses AI to assist designers and researchers with feedback on the experiences they create. It can record interactions with a Figma prototype, pose questions on behalf of an interviewer, record video, and transcribe the entire conversation. Most importantly, it looks for common themes amongst respondents and organizes them for researchers to consider.

Students quickly realized Listen AI – like most AI systems – is at its best when focused and constrained. They quickly received detailed feedback on the very first iteration of their prototypes. One student realized that people using her design didn't realize they needed to swipe horizontally to access an option. *Seeing* that from the people she's designing for is far more impactful than simply considering a suggestion in class.

Empowering designers (and especially design *students*) with the means to obtain meaningful feedback on their first prototypes – barely more than sketches – is profound. Design thinking is iterative; AI platforms like Listen AI can infuse testing throughout the process. Often it's left until the very end, and applied only to near final designs. 

Of course, students deliberately pushed the limits of AI "thinking". When unleashed to create dozens of follow up questions and generate a needlessly long report, they achieved predictably laughable results. While powerful, platforms like Listen are not going to replace the expertise of dedicated user researchers or make informed design decisions. 

As we wrapped up the project and shared our solutions, I reminded students that they'll soon be taking a design research class. Whatever AI tools they choose to use, the skills and processes they'll learn are still *vitally* important. Because we can begin gathering feedback in early iterations of the process, hands-on and in-person testing can be more focused, informative and validating.

Emerging tools like these shift design thinking work rather than replacing it. Designers and researchers will be expected to better informed and more confident in the design decisions we make. As AI empowers our discipline, *more* is demanded of us, not less.

<p class="footnotes"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Credit for the Design Thinking illustration goes to Bharghavi Kirubasankar and his 2020 article <em>critical</em> of the process. I agree with his overall assessment of how design thinking is marketed to clients. Still, the framework is especially useful for students and I believe AI tools can bring greater depth and thoughtfulness to our craft.</p>


<p class="footnotes"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> After seeing their presentation I <em>raced</em> to talk further with Listenlabs founder Alfred Wahlforss. I asked if my class could try their platform and offered to write about it. Beyond this, Listenlabs had no imput on this post and didn't sponsor or compensate me in any way.</p>
