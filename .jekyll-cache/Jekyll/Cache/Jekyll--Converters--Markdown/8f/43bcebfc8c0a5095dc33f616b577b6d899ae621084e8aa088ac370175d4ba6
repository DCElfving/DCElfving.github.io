  <p><b>This is the portfolio site of Dave Elfving.</b> I'm a teacher, artist and Experience Designer living in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>My work explores the relationship between human perception and that of Machine Learning and AI systems. In short: I love mashing up data and traditional darkroom photography.</p>

  <p>I'm also a volunteer and mentor, actively seeking teaching opportunities to empower others with tools for creativity.</p>

  <p>I'm on the advisory board at <a href="http://www.firstexposures.org">First Exposures</a>, a youth photography program based in SF. I also serve on the board of <a href="http://www.sfcamerawork.org">SF Camerawork</a> and filled in as its Interim Executive Director in 2020. I often work on projects at <a href="http://www.humanmade.org">Humanmade</a>, and occasionally volunteer as a Teaching Assistant at <a href="http://www.grayarea.org">Gray Area</a>.</p>
