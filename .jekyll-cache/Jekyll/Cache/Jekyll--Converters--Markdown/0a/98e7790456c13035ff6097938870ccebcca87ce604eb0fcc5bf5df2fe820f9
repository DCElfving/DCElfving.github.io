I"™<p>After creating the first Portraits project, I wanted to explore projecting onto a moving surface. Technically, this was far more complicated than the first version, and allowed me to explore working with Arduino and an array of servos.</p>

<p>One of the more compelling aspects of the piece was accidental. Visitors were intrigued by the sound of the moving servos as much as the visual aspect of the piece. Iâ€™d like to explore this further and with more intention.</p>
