I"?<p>So it’s Spring of 2022, and <a href="https://blog.metaphysic.ai/what-is-the-latent-space-of-an-image-synthesis-system/">Latent Space Image Walks</a> are a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/13/loab-ai-generated-horror/">thing</a>. To understand more about Machine Learning, I used stamps made available by the <a href="https://postalmuseum.si.edu">Smithsonian</a> to train a model, and displayed the results on a stamp sized screen.</p>

<p>The results were, as expected, creepy. But strangely compelling as they merged together and melted apart. Philatelic amoebas…</p>

<p>I wanted to realize the images as <em>actual</em> stamps, so I printed some up and placed them in a plastic “Stamps of the World” album.</p>
