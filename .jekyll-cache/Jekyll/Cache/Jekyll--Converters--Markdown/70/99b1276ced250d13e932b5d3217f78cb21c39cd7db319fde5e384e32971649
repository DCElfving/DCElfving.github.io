I"<p>After creating the first <a href="http://localhost:4000/project/01-portraits">Portraits</a> project, I wanted to explore projecting onto a moving surface. Technically, this was far more complicated than the first version, and allowed me to explore working with Arduino and an array of servos.</p>

<p>One of the more compelling aspects of the piece was accidental. Visitors were intrigued by the sound of the moving servos as much as the visual aspect of the piece. I’d like to explore this further and with more intention.</p>

<p>A closer look at the mechanism behind the array. Each servo is mounted in a 3D printed actuator, and each “tile” requires 13 discrete parts. Having managed 16 tiles (with a lot of trouble shooting) I’d like to try this at a larger scale and with multiple pieces.</p>
