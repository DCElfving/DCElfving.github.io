<h2>Little Stars</h2>
<p class="sub"><small><strong>A project proposal for Gray Area Immersive, 2019</strong></small></p>

<blockquote><i>When he shall die, <br/>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,  <br/>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine <br/>
 That all the world will be in love with night  <br/>
And pay no worship to the garish sun. <br/>
<strong>― William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet</strong></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! <br/>
<strong>― William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet</strong></i></blockquote>

<h3>The Audience:</h3>
<p>With a focus facial expression and human emotion, the project aims to be universally accessible.</p>

<p>In practice, the work has obvious appeal for the XR community, and those intrigued by the possibilites technology in the arts. As a new approach to portraiture, it also engages audiences drawn to photography and lens-based art.</p>


<h3>Three Descriptive Words:</h3>
<p><strong>Empathetic:</strong><br/>
We automatically register emotion and intent through facial expression; we're attuned to each other this way. As a form of portaiture in augmented reality, the work should elicit a sense of empahty.</p>

<p><strong>Absorbing:</strong><br/>
As the three dimensional forms change to reflect different people and expressions, it will be difficult to look away – we're naturally drawn to faces.</p>

<p><strong>Concerning:</strong><br/>
The technologies that allow for an art piece like this, are the same technologies we use to unlock our phones, and the same technologies that allow oppressive regimes to track dissidents. Our relationship with faces and facial expressions is no longer purely human – it has been digitized and quantified.</p>

<h3>Inspirational Works:</h3>

<p><strong>The Crown Fountain, Chicago</strong><br/>
There are obvious parallels here, but I didn’t immediately make the connection. Though overshadowed by “The Bean” the fountain takes faces from the community and integrates them into a beautiful and engaging public artwork.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
	<!--end fountain gallery-->

<p>In Summer, children of every imaginable background play together there. A massive, digitized face could be oppressive and menacing, but the Crown fountain is decidedly <em>welcoming</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Max Headroom</strong><br/>
While I hope to avoid the 80’s aesthetic, Max was the first widely recognizable digital character. Importantly, he was fun and playful – mischievous.</p>

	<div><a href="images/max2.jpg"><img class="gallery_img" src="images/max2.jpg"></a></div>
	</div>
	</div>
	<!--end max gallery-->

<p>Though realized with the similar technologies, Max was far more approachable than the hard, wireframe portraits of Daft Punk or the terror of Lawnmower Man.</p>


<p><strong>Giusuppe Archimbaldo</strong><br/>
I remember seeing posters of his work when I was young – the man made of vegetables, the woman of flowers. I came across his work again as the idea of a point cloud rendered in stars or flowers began to take shape.</p>

	<!--max gallery-->
	<div class="gallery">

	</div>
	</div>
	<!--end max gallery-->

<p>Others have made portraits like these (see moodboard), but his work is the earliest – and best – prior art I can find. While not exactly in this style, it's close to how I see the final portraits rendered.</p>

<h3>Create a Moodboard:</h3>
<p>My initial searches let to hard, technological images – LIDAR scans and matrix style effects. But modifying that search with organic terms like "leaves" and "flowers" led to less abrasive examples. I'm still adding to the <a href="http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/V3CIpsTG/share">full moodboard</a> as I come across additional examples and inspiration.</p>

<h3>Create a Tag Cloud:</h3>
<p>I knew “face” would loom large, but I was surprised to see “technologies” and “oppressive” emerge.  This gets at the tension I hope the finished work evokes. Something beautiful, human and engaging, but tinged by the uncertain future of our identity.</p>

<h2>Scanning the World</h2>
<p>Lately, I've been obsessed with volumetrically scanning objects in nature. There's something profound about capturing a physical object from a place; a three dimensional snapshot.</p>

<p>For now, this means carefully hovering around rocks and trees with my iPhone. A few apps are able to take advantage of the depth sensor used for Face ID. It's nascent and clunky technology, but it taps into something deeply human: the desire to hold onto a souvenir from an important moment.</p>

<p>When placed in virtual and augmented reality, these become incredibly interesting. The technology opens up entirely new possibilities for assemblage art, and might redefine how we collect and display meaningful objects.</p>

<p>I'm still experimenting, but have had success in visualizing and manipulating scanned items and textures with the Microsoft HoloLens.</p>

<h2>Non-Linear Storyboards</h2>
<p>I'd an idea for a narrative AR experience, but faced a problem. How do you write a script that allows for user choice and agency?</p>

<p>A few false starts led me to Twine, an amazing environment for writing interactive fiction. Think old school <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> books.</p>

	</div>
	</div>
	<!--end gallery 2-->

<p>Very much in progress, I've only a few screenshots to share. Designed in the style of a silent film, I plan to replace the descriptions with illustrations and use the finished interactive storyboard to inform an immersive work.</p>

<p>Twine uses a bespoke markup and scripting language meant to be approachable to non-developers. More than simply helping me realize an idea, it has rekindled an interest in coding.</p>

<h2>In the Darkroom</h2>
<p>Photography isn't a new idea or project, it's a constant.</p>

<p>The camera has always blurred the lines between art, science and technology. I don't know how many times I've developed a roll of film or made a print, but it's always magical.</p>

<p>I share a studio and darkroom in the Excelsior neighborhood of San Francisco, on one of the most surveilled intersections in the city. Nearby lamp posts bristle with police cameras. If you're in the area, you're being recorded.</p>

<p>I'm interested in exploring and commenting on this surveillance by coupling computer vision with analog photography.</p>
